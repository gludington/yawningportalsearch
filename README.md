## To install

## What is this
A bookmarklet is a little snippet of javascript that can add functionality to the current page.  This adds a search form to WoTC's Yawning Portal Search
## Why is this
WoTC's yawning portal site lists upcoming games for Virtual Weekend and D&D Celebration events.  The games are presented as one long page.  I wanted to be able to search by game, by time, by VTT, and even by DM or other text.
